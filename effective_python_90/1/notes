item 3 to remember:
Things to Remember
✦ bytes contains sequences of 8-bit values, and str contains
sequences of Unicode code points.
✦ Use helper functions to ensure that the inputs you operate on
are the type of character sequence that you expect (8-bit values,
UTF-8-encoded strings, Unicode code points, etc).
✦ bytes and str instances can’t be used together with operators (like
>, ==, +, and %).
✦ If you want to read or write binary data to/from a file, always open
the file using a binary mode (like 'rb' or 'wb').
✦ If you want to read or write Unicode data to/from a file, be care-
ful about your system’s default text encoding. Explicitly pass the
encoding parameter to open if you want to avoid surprises.
